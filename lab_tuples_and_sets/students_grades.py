'''Write a program that reads students' names and their grades and adds them to the student record.
On the first line, you will receive the number of students â€“ N. On the following N lines, you will be receiving a student's name and grade.
For each student print all his/her grades and finally his/her average grade, formatted to the second decimal point in the format: "{student's name} -> {grade1} {grade2} ... {gradeN} (avg: {average_grade})".
The order in which we print the result does not matter.
Example:
7
Peter 5.20
Mark 5.50
Peter 3.20
Mark 2.50
Alex 2.00
Mark 3.46
Alex 3.00
