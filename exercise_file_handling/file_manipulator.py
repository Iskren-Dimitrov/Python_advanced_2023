'''Create a program that will receive commands until the command "End". The commands can be:

路 "Create-{file_name}" - Creates the given file with an empty content. If the file already exists, remove the existing\
text in it (as if the file is created again)

路 "Add-{file_name}-{content}" - Append the content and a new line after it. If the file does not exist, create it,\
and add the content

路 "Replace-{file_name}-{old_string}-{new_string}" - Open the file and replace all the occurrences of the old string\
with the new string. If the file does not exist, print: "An error occurred"

路 "Delete-{file_name}" - Delete the file. If the file does not exist, print: "An error occurred"
Example:
Create-file.txt
Add-file.txt-First Line
Add-file.txt-Second Line
Replace-random.txt-Some-some
Replace-file.txt-First-1st
Replace-file.txt-Second-2nd
Delete-random.txt
Delete-file.txt
End
