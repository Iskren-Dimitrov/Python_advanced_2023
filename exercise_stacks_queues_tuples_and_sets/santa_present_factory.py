'''This year Santa has decided to share his secret with you. Get ready to learn how his elves craft all the presents.
First, you will receive a sequence of integers representing the number of materials for crafting toys in one box. After\
that, you will be given another sequence of integers â€“ their magic level.
Your task is to mix materials with magic so you can craft presents, listed in the table below with the exact magic level:
Example:
10 -5 20 15 -30 10
40 60 10 4 10 0
